# Portfolio CMS

Ruby Version: 3.4.4 \
I made a DIY hardcoded headless CMS (content management system) for my portfolio as a learning exercise for myself to learn Ruby on Rails. \
There is a login feature (no signup since it's meant to be single user; the initial user can be created in the Rails production console), ability to add, modify, and delete entries, and finally a JSON API that delivers the data. \
The frontend will be made in React, but has not been completed yet, but this will be updated when it is.
